              What is my interest in IT
            </b>
          </h5>

          <p>
            IT is for solving problems. IT is a tool for make processes more efficient. With IT, you can 
            transform a business process into action. You can remove the jams, smooth out the edges, automate, 
            calibrate, refine and iterate. IT lets you focus on the content while it does the process.

                When did my interest in IT start

            </h5>
  
            <p>
                
              I once built a database to collate the details of the lease agreements held by a government 
              department. I did this as a simple inventory, which I needed. Before I had finished, I realised 
              I could link this data to a calendar and generate a to-do list. I realised then I could use IT 
              as my assistant, making my day easier and helping me keep on top of the jobs I need to do.

              <p>
                  
                Business is a world dominated by processes. I found myself sitting in front of a word processor 
                that could do so much more. I hope it isn’t narcissistic to say, but it was my own inquisitiveness 
                that sparked my interest.

                  I started with spreadsheets and databases. 
                  Then scripts in VB and python.
                   When I began to study at RMIT, the bigger world of IT opened up for me. 
                   I have learnt to do lots of interesting things with IT, but my instincts 
                   are still to look for roles that IT can play in improving process design.

                    My criteria for deciding how to study were these: It had to be online, 
                    flexibility in the load each semester and a focus on technical skills. 
                    OUA offered this environment. RMIT was the most technical offering OUA provided.

              A first step would be to gain a job as a junior developer in a position where I 
              work with a broad range of technologies. Seek out opportunities to work with clients 
              in developing new, or enhancing existing, functionality. Undertake some projects where 
              I can gain high proficiency in one of these technologies so that I have skills I can 
              teach to other people.

              Their description of the test is that it will generate a four-letter type code according to 
              Jung's typology as developed by Myers, Briggs, von Franz, and van der Hoop. The test is one of 
              several ways to quantify interpretations of Jung's typology, similar but not identical, to 
              the MBTI test (the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® MBTI), the Jung Type Indicator, and other

              Analytical, knowledgeable, and intellectual, you prefer to immerse yourself in complex problems and projects. 
              If the interest is there, you can become so engulfed in a problem and your thoughts about it that you tend to 
              forget about everyday living and become absent-minded and remote. You are driven by a desire to understand and 
              explore the problems that interest you on an intellectual level, which means that sometimes you are more interested 
              in the ideas that govern a given problem than in the actual problem itself. You want to go your own ways and you 
              resent being controlled or told what to do. And to your credit, you do not want to control other people either,

              The Disc personality test is an alternative to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) that is 
              commonly used in the business community.  MBTI is based on the work of Carl Jung, DISC is based 
              on the theories of William Mouton Marston. Both Jung and Marston specialized in similar fields, 
              hence the tests are similar. 
            </p>
            <p>             
              MBTI sorts individuals into 16 personality types, while DISC focuses primarily on 4 dominant personality types 
              (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Compliant). MBTI is largely an indicator of an individual’s internal thinking, 
              while DISC is designed to measure how personality translates to external behaviour.

                Fact-finders have highly developed "quality control" and critical thinking ability. They favour logic and facts but also possess intuitive skills that they will meld with the facts. Preparation is essential before action. They may appear shy but can work with others who have similar high-quality focus. They avoid confrontational situations. Because they need to "get it right", can delay decisions. If they make a mistake, they will likely research additional material to
                support their original choice.

        <p>          
          I cannot disagree with the results of these tests.   
          
        </p>
        <p>
          I am far less ridge than the DISC analysis portrays me. 
          I am not averse to uncertainty, nor prone to over-react to criticism. 
          For these reasons I speculate I've not completed the DISC well.  
          
        </p>
        <p>
          I have long felt that I need a team around me to help me see into my blind spots, and these tests support this intuition. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In a team, I may not communicate how I feel about an issue when it is divisive. I might get overly absorbed  
          on a single task and loss sight of the bigger picture. I may lose my patience with team members that do not focus 
          on solving technical issues.

              If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember 
              things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, 
              or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some physical activity is involved. You 
              need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, 
              and you may have difficulty sitting still.
            </p>
            <p>     
              As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, 
              and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. 
              You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily 
              remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or 
              heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically 
              expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.           

          </p>
          <p>                                         
          
            Here are some things that tactile learners like you can do to learn better:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing.</li>
              <li>Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories.</li>
              <li>It's OK to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying.</li>
              <li>Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas.</li>
              <li>Trace words with your finger to learn to spell (finger-spelling).</li>
              <li>Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long).</li>
              <li>It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning.</li>
              <li>Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch.</li>
          </ul>     

            <p>
              Remember that you learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing.

            </b>
          </h5>

          <p>
            My project idea is to build an application that can help a pool shop provide profitable maintenance services to their clients.  
          </p>

          
          <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-text-teal">
            Background 
          </h6>
          <p>
            Pool shops usually have a maintenance arm that provides a full-service option, for clients that would prefer 
            a pool man come around and keep the pool in tip-top condition for them. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The maintenance business is a dependable 
            income-steam for the shop, but it could also easily be a big headache. The difference between these two alternate 
            outcomes is scheduling, and that is what technology can do.
          </p>

          <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-text-teal">
            Details 
          </h6>
          <p>
            Considering a single maintenance job, the profitability of the job is the price less the cost of inputs. 
            The local market sets the price, so it is some-what inflexible. The business must drive profitability through 
            the control of its inputs. 
          </p>

          <p>There are three input costs: </p>
          <ol>            
            <li>labour, </li>
            <li>travel (fuel and vehicle maintenance), </li>
            <li>pool chemicals. </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I believe that travel time is as much, if not more, than the time spent doing the job. 
            This means labour and travel costs are closely related to eachother.
          </p>
          <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-text-teal">
            Summary 
          </h6>
          <p>
            My idea is that scheduling and route planning can reduce the time spent travelling between jobs. 
            With optimised routes, both the cost of labour and travel for each job decreases. Also, the number 
            of tasks completed in a day can increase.

            Aim: to optimise the routes pool maintenance technicians use to travel between their daily jobs list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please read the user story written in the outcome section below. 
            The user story has helped me discover how the application will function, but it is just one story. 
            I see two users for the start-up phase of the project, being: the pool technician (Mr Pools) 
            and the shop administrator (Ms Spa). Ms Spa’s job is to organise Mr Pools. She will need access to 
            the system to add jobs, adjust priorities and communicate with clients. Ms Spa would also use the 
            system to complete billing. She does not need the mapping/route facility. The third user – an enhancement – would 
            be the client. They might log in to undertake tasks such as: see their jobs, pay bills, approve new work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project is a web application with three significant parts. 
            It requires a backend database and a front-end content management system. 
            It will also need a sophisticated algorithm to produce the technician’s daily route.
          </p>
          <p>
            The front-end would have to be GPS enabled so that it can 
            interact with the routing/mapping functionality. Essentially it is a jobs list and a route display. 
            The front end would also report back time in progress, so it acts as an activity logger. It would 
            have basic stock inventory functionality. And some billing functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The back-end database stores data and requires user group authorisation. 
            The data needed includes three tables: job characteristics (time to complete, materials, due 
            date, due date flexibility, job priority), property (the pool's location), client info.
          </p>
          <p>
            The route optimisation algorithm will work with the data stored in the database. 
            It will produce an ordered jobs list that is passed to a mapping API.  Although I would 
            expect it to work on the fly, I would also expect it to plan each week. Looking at the 
            job due in the week, it would lump them geographically to reduce travel between jobs. 
            The algorithm should make minor adjustments through the week in response to work added 
            to the schedule in an ad-hoc way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ms Spa would require the capacity to do long-range route optimisation. 
            She could look far into the future, say 12 months, ahead. Then she might tweak 
            the projected jobs list to get more optimisation out of the system; a scenario analyses functionality.

            To complete the project, I will need skills in database implementation and front-end development. 
            I will also need to know how to use the mapping API that will drive the route optimisation algorithm.  
            There are several APIs available 
            (

        <p>
          User story for pool technician (Mr Pools).
        </p>

        <p>
          
          At the start of the day, Mr Pools logs into his device and sees a list of jobs. 
          He can review a map of his itinerary, showing the path he will travel for the day. 
          The app also provides a list of materials he will need (based on the job type). 
          Mr Pools loads his van and heads off following the onboard directions. When he arrives at the first job the 
          app records the start time (and stops when he departs). At the end of the job, Mr Pools ticks it 
          complete and records the actual chemicals he used (for billing). He updates when the job will next be due. 
          While completing the maintenance, Mr Pools noticed that the filter cartage needs replacing. He records this as
          a future job so it can be presented to the client and scheduled if it is approved. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr Pools jumps back in the van, 
          selects the next job and a map displays. He has a drink of water, turns up the radio and drives off.
